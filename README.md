# Brain Tumor Classification using EfficientNetB0 & EfficientNetB1

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model using EfficientNetB0 and EfficientNetB1 to classify brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained to distinguish between four categories of brain tumors:
- Glioma
- Meningioma
- Pituitary
- No Tumor

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the **Brain Tumor MRI Dataset**, structured as follows:
```
Brain Tumor MRI Dataset/
  ├── Training/
  │   ├── Glioma/
  │   ├── Meningioma/
  │   ├── Pituitary/
  │   ├── No Tumor/
  ├── Testing/
      ├── Glioma/
      ├── Meningioma/
      ├── Pituitary/
      ├── No Tumor/
```

## Model Architecture
We utilized **EfficientNetB0** and **EfficientNetB1**, which are lightweight and high-performing convolutional neural networks (CNNs). The models were fine-tuned on the dataset to achieve high accuracy while maintaining efficiency.

## Training Process
- Data was preprocessed and normalized.
- Images were augmented to improve generalization.
- The dataset was split into **training** and **validation** sets.
- The models were trained using **TensorFlow and Keras**.

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/brain-tumor-classification.git
   cd brain-tumor-classification
   ```
2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
3. Test the model on new images:
   ```bash
   python predict.py --image path/to/image.png
   ```

## Conclusion
EfficientNet models demonstrated strong classification capabilities for brain tumor MRI scans. **EfficientNetB1 outperformed EfficientNetB0**, making it the preferred choice for real-world applications.

## Future Improvements
- Experimenting with EfficientNetB2-B7 for better accuracy.
